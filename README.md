# Homework 8

* coin flip.py [Python] flipping a coin with a known true probability of landing heads, and then calculates the posterior distribution for the parameter that defines this probability, using a Bayesian approach

* coin flip figure.png

# Homework 9

* Quadratic function.py [Python]

* Quadratic function to minimize.png

* Quadratic function with minimium.png

# Implementation


matplotlib (python)
numpy (pyhon)
scipy.integrate (python)
sympy (python)



coin flip.py and Quadratic function.py

can be run from the Command/Terminal line by typing:

<> python coin flip.py 

<> Quadratic function.py 


This requires a working Python distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python packages numpy, sympy, scipy.integrate and Matplotlib also installed.

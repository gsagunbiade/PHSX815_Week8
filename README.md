# Implementation


matplotlib (python)
numpy (pyhon)
scipy.integrate (python)
sympy (python)



coin flip.py

can be run from the Command/Terminal line by typing:

<> python coin flip.py 


This requires a working Python distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python packages numpy, sympy, scipy.integrate and Matplotlib also installed.
